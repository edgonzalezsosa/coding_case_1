# Coding Case 1

The company has decided to handle Dealership's inventory in this example.
Our first test dealership is 'Rodriguez Sin Chequeo de Credito!' and they just
received a big order.

For our first program, the dealership wants to verify the following:

1. Which vehicles are in inventory
2. Which vehicles are red
3. Which vehicles are blue
4. Which vehicles are electric

That's a piece of cake!

Now that our first task is completed we need to take a look at our code and see if we
can improve it.

1. Can you find an example of encapsulation and explain?
2. Can you find an example of abstraction and explain?
3. Can you find an example of inheritance and explain?
4. Can you find an example of polymorphism and explain?
5. Can you explain the similarities and differences of the methods 'printAllBlueVehicles' and 'printAllRedVehicles'?
6. Is it possible to write the method 'areAllElectricVehicles' using lambda expressions? If so, can you show me?
7. Can you tell me the time complexity of the method 'printAllBlueVehicles'?
